# Split_Cases
Split cases behavior in event logs: a detection method

This code implements the split cases detection approch suggested in "Detecting the “split-cases” workaround in event logs".

The inputs for the method appear in lines 5-17; Please change them according to your event log.
The timeframe_size and iteration_size are calculated in lines 89-91. The calculation is based on the mean time between cases.
